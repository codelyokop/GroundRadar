Ground Radar Plugin Configs for LSAS

Hello, here is the configs as of yet with work in progress.

settings are based from ground mode
1 possible change to app window to show extentions, though not ideal for with Geneva due to grass runway defined in sct

LSGG has been completed to my ability

LSZH work in progress
stand borders all defined
block codes tempoarily used while we dont have adjacent wingspan restriction infomation
most have max wingspan set, from file https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pXfWYg4s2NXLhBySmq9ZFib3zMFF6bT5InZ0KKuJdQk/edit?usp=sharing
Stands not part of most scenerys set to manual assign
stands shown based off current IRL stands which remain


This has been my project that i have been doing each night and has come a long way in a short timeframe.
The intrest starting while i was working to properly set up my topsky install.
